# Pong-Game-Python

This project is a modern implementation of the classic **Pong Game**, developed to practice advanced programming concepts using Python and the `turtle` library. The primary focus of this project was to reinforce **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, explore Python's event handling capabilities, and design an interactive gaming experience.

### Key Features
- **Responsive Paddle Controls**: Smooth movement of paddles for an intuitive gameplay experience.
- **Dynamic Scoring System**: Tracks and updates player scores in real-time.
- **Collision Mechanics**: Precise detection of ball-paddle and ball-boundary collisions.
- **Local Multiplayer Mode**: Designed for two players to enjoy competitive gameplay.

### Gameplay Objective

### Controls
- **Player 1 (Left Paddle)**:
  - **Move Up**: Press `W`
  - **Move Down**: Press `S`
- **Player 2 (Right Paddle)**:
